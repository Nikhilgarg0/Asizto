--first update--
1. Step 2: Otp input is not lettin the keyboard stay on screen, it is hiding the keyboard again and again.
2. while enetering otp, the numbers are not fully visible, it is being cut.
3. Step 3: continue button is not wokring.
4. remove the emogis from the screen.
5. the screen is scrollable right now, we have to manage the layout in such a way that it should be a fixed screen.
6. There should be some very good transitions between the steps, forward and backward too.
7. i believe ther is a space at the bottom which is overlapping the other content as we scroll, fix this.
8. The background animations should be more better and subtle, which should match the theme as well.

--second update--
1. As we does not want this page to be scrolled, the layout should be like that the content should not overflow, either redesign the layout, or increase the steps to reduce content in single step.
2. in the step 2, as we enter otp, first of all the keyboard is glitching, it just appears for a fraction of seconds and disappear again, and the second thing is the digits we enter in the otp box, the digits are not visible as it is flowing out of screen in a hidden manner.
